This is an implementation of the paper:

Jiaying Liu, Sifeng Xia, Wenhan Yang, Mading Li, and Dong Liu. "One-for-All: Grouped Variation Network Based Fractional Interpolation in Video Coding", IEEE Trans. on Image Processing (TIP), Vol.28, No.5, pp.2140-2151, May 2019. 

This work uses deep learnning techniques to improve the fractional interpolation performance in HEVC.

Caffe models and prototxt files are in the folder model.
